frontend-nanodegree-feedreader
=============================

This is my version of a JavaScript feedreader app tested using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).

This project provided experience with writing tests against a pre-existing JavaScript application using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).


**Objective of the Project:**


* To learn how to use Jasmine to write tests against a pre-existing application.
* Create tests that are comprehensive enough to test app functionality.

###Running the Tests:

To run the tests, clone from my github account:

```
https://github.com/clarkgroce/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
```

and then open index.html in your browser.

The Jasmine spec results will show at the bottom of the window.

###Results:

* All required tests pass and are comprehensive enough to test the app.


###Resources Used:
